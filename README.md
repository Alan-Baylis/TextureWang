# TextureWang
Node based procedural texture generator for unity.

Work in progress.

Uses a somewhat modified copy of https://github.com/Seneral/Node_Editor_Framework  taken about July 2016

Note, while the source is public, the code istelf is not open source.

Its simply my intent to stop others from being able to package up this code or derivative and sell it on the Unity Asset Store or any other store.

Textures generated by this tool are free from any license and can be used commercially/sold.
